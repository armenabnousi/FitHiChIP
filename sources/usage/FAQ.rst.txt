How do I cite FitHiChIP?
-------------------------

FitHiChIP should be cited as:

Sourya Bhattacharyya, Vivek Chandra, Pandurangan Vijayanand, and Ferhat Ay, *FitHiChIP: Identification of significant chromatin contacts from HiChIP data*, preprint at <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/10/412833>, DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1101/412833>


I do not know anything about HiChIP. What should I do?
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to read the FitHiChIP paper, users are requested to read the following papers for a 
detailed understanding of HiC and HiChIP protocols.

	2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143423/ (PLAC-seq)

Hi-C related basic papers:

How to install HiC-pro in the system?
-----------------------------------------

HiC-pro is available through GitHub <https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro> (corresponding documentation is available in <http://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/>). The simple way is to either download GitHub archieve in a zipped format, or to clone the repository. Then, user needs to perform the following steps:

	1. (Extract the zipped archieve if downloaded.) Go to the directory containing HiC-pro (generally inside the folder name **HiC-Pro-master**)

	2. Edit the file **config-install.txt** by specifying the path names of required packages.

	3. Type **make configure** in the command line, and press enter.

	4. Once configuration is performed, type **make CONFIG_SYS=config-install.txt install** in the command line, and press enter. Successful execution of this command would install HiC-pro in a folder named **HiC-Pro_*VERSIONNAME***


How to specify the HiC-pro base installation directory in the FitHiChIP configuration file?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specify the absolute path of the HiC-pro installation directory **HiC-Pro_*VERSIONNAME*** in the configuration file.


How to visualize the FitHiChIP loops in genome browser?
-----------------------------------------------------------

FitHiChIP supports using WashU epigenome browser for visualizing significant loops. For details, please check 
the page :ref:`Details of FitHiChIP outputs` for a detailed description.


What type of interactions are supported in FitHiChIP?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently FitHiChIP supports finding statistically significant CIS interactions. The foreground (output interaction type) depends on the option **IntType** (parameter B.5 in :ref:`Setting up configuration file`). Default mode of FitHiChIP is to report peak-to-all interactions (one end is a peak, while the other end may or may not be a peak).
