Utilities of FitHiChIP at a glance
------------------------------------

	- FitHiChIP derives the statistical significant CIS interactions from a given HiChIP / PLAC-seq data.
	- CIS Interactions are derived with respect to a specific distance range (default = 20 Kb to 2 Mb: can be user defined).
	- Input of FitHiChIP is the valid CIS read pairs generated from the HiC-Pro pipeline (Servant et. al. 2015), the most commonly used Hi-C data processing pipeline.
	- These CIS read pairs are used to find the statistically significant loops within the given distance range.
	- FitHiChIP uses the distance decay model of the interaction count, proposed in the method FitHiC (Ay and Noble, 2014). 
	- In addition, FitHiChIP applies a bias specific regression model to find the statistical significant interactions.
